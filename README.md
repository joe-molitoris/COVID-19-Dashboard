# COVID-19-Dashboard
Creates an interactive dashboard to monitor COVID-19 cases across the globe and over time.

The data are taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and I can make no claim to the data's completeness or accuracy.  The data may be accessed here: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide.
